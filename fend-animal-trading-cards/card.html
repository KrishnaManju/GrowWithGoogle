					Good-looking, smart and fun-loving, the Lab has a a lot going for him. He’s large, but
					not too large, he’s calm and easygoing when he’s not exuberantly fetching a tennis ball 
					or a bird. He’s a do-it-all kind of dog.

				Labs come in three colors: black, yellow and chocolate.A nice Lab puppy can usually be 
				purchased for $700 to $1,500. For this price you should expect the puppies to have been 
				raised in a clean environment, from parents with health clearances and show or field 
				championships to prove that they are good specimens of the breed. Puppies have been 
				temperament tested, vetted, dewormed, and socialized to give them a healthy, confident
				start in life.
